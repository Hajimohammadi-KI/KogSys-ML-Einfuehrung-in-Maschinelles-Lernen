    "### **Implement a Perceptron**\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to implement an efficient thresholded perceptron using ``numpy``. For today, we will only be relying on ``scikit-learn`` for the ``ClassifierMixin`` base class for our perceptron (and for data management).\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our Perceptron to do the following things (in order of importance):\n",
    "1. Implement the Perceptron Training Rule and classify both _single and sets of samples_\n",
    "2. Automatically adapt to any input we pass as training data, i.e. do not have set a number of input features on construction\n",
    "3. Work with any class labels, i.e. no matter wether the classes are named ``0`` and ``1`` or \"apple\" and \"pear\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **$b$ or $w_0$?**\n",
    "\n",
    "You have to make a choice whether you want to implement the bias as a standalone additive factor, or as part of the weight vector. Both implementations have their advantages and drawbacks, neither is \"easier\" than the other. Whereas the $w_0$ approach requires you to make some data transformations within some (maybe just one?) of the methods for the approach to work, the $b$ approach will not cause you any troubles on that end, but requires some additional lines of code which are easily forgotten.\n",

    "\n",
    "From our implementation of a Decision Tree ensemble in the third tutorial session, you know how the ``ClassifierMixin`` base class works, and that it requires the implementation of the ``predict`` method. For neural networks, it makes sense to add an intermediate method, the ``forward`` method. The ``forward`` method calculates the raw network output, whereas the ``predict`` method turns that output into a class prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note how this relates to the third point of our implementation goal: The predict method works as a translator, turning the $+1$ and $-1$ network outputs into a prediction for arbitrary class labels."
